### Welcome to the Speech and Mind Lab!

Our lab investigates the human mind that produce, perceive and comprehend spoken language. We integrate insights from linguistics, cognitive science, psychology and artificial intelligence with an aim to deepen our understanding of speech communication.

We are interested in working with students and researchers who have similar interests but come from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise, including linguistics, psychology and neuroscience and AI. If youâ€™re interested in applying for a postgraduate program under the supervision of Prof. Jieun Song, please refer to the DHCSS and CT websites, as well as the KAIST admission webpage for more general info.
