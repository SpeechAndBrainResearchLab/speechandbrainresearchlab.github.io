description: In addition to behavioral methods, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to explore various issues in speech processing. We measure both Event-Related Potential responses (ERPs) and neural oscillations with state-of-the-art analysis techniques (e.g., temporal response function), which allow us to examine perceptual and cognitive processes that unfold in real-time at multiple levels (auditory, phonetic, lexical, and semantic). Currently, we are investigating auditory and lexical processing when listening to fast vs. slow speech, how listeners use linguistic information (e.g., semantic context) and cognitive effort to recognize words during and after sentence presentation, and how these processes differ depending on individuals (e.g., differences in cognitive skills and age)
