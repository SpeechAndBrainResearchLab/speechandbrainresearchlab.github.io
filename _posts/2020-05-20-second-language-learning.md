title: Second Language Speech Learning

description: In addition to behavioral methods, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to explore various issues in speech processing. We measure both Event-Related Potential responses (ERPs) and neural oscillations with state-of-the-art analysis techniques (e.g., temporal response function), which allow us to examine perceptual and cognitive processes that unfold in real-time at multiple levels (auditory, phonetic, lexical, and semantic). Currently, we are investigating auditory and lexical processing when listening to fast vs. slow speech, how listeners use linguistic information (e.g., semantic context) and cognitive effort to recognize words during and after sentence presentation, and how these processes differ depending on individuals (e.g., differences in cognitive skills and age)

Speech perception is flexible in that perceptual processes of individuals can adapt as they gain experience in a new sound system of a non-native language. High Variability Phonetic Training (HVPT) in particular has proven effective for second language speech learning, as it exposes learners to the variability (e.g., different speakers or phonetic contexts) needed to develop robust sound categories. However, speech perception often takes place in adverse listening conditions (e.g., noise, multitasking), and learning to recognizing sounds in these conditions requires adapting to the insufficient cues available, as well as modulating attention to stay focused on the target speech.

Recent work from our lab, conducted by Master’s student Haeun Oh, investigated the effects of HVPT in high cognitive load conditions using VR. She created a realistic learning environment by developing a VR driving game where learners drive and receive phonetic training simultaneously in the presence of environmental noise. She found that this training helped learners to develop strategies for coping with cognitive challenges in difficult listening conditions (e.g., ignoring background speech). We’re interested in continuing research on phonetic training and second-language speech learning in the future.
