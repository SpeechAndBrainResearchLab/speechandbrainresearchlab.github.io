With the recent advancements in AI and large language models, AI voice-interactive systems are becoming our new conversational partners. They are capable of performing a variety of complex tasks, but we still do not know much about their behaviour and capabilities as a communication partner compared to humans. We have embarked on an exciting project on how speakers adapt their language and speech when talking with an AI system to accommodate these differences and facilitate effective communication.
