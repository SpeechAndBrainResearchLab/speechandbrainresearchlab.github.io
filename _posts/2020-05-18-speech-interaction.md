As voice-based technologies using synthetic speech has become ubiquitous in everyday life, research on speech interaction has been gradually expanding to include human-AI speech interaction. While human to human speech interaction is rich in linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues, interactions with AI systems often differ in conversational flow. Our lab focuses on the linguistic phenomena that emerge in interactions with synthetic voices, with particular interest in how people adapt their language and interpret vocal cues when communicating with non-human speakers.
