Through speech, we communicate linguistic messages – words and sentences – with one another. However, speech sounds also convey rich nonlinguistic and paralinguistic information, such as the emotional states, attitudes, or social identity cues. Our lab investigates how speech functions as a medium for expressing such nonlinguistic cues, with particular interest in how vocal cues shape listeners' perceptions. By examining acoustic-phonetic features, we aim to understand how listeners interpret these cues to form impressions about speaker. This research deepens our understanding about human speech communication within conversational contexts and informs the development of socially intelligent AI voices.
